## Mammography-prediction-model

The project was created as a portfolio project to create a deep-learning model to analyze breast mammography images and predict malignancy. I am creating a model of my own while using pre-trained classification models and finetuning it. The models used till now are ResNet18, ResNet50 and EfficientNet.
It is still a work in progress
